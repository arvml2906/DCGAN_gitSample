# DCGAN Implementation

DCGAN
DCGAN uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the generator and discriminator, respectively. The input image is of dimensions 32x32x3. The output image is also a 32x32x3 image.

The implementation was done on Google colab. Images were downloaded on to google drive and subsequently used in the notebook. 

Refer  ``` Training_code.ipynb``` for the training code.
