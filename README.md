# DCGAN Implementation

DCGAN uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the generator and discriminator, respectively. The input image is of dimensions 32x32x3. The output image is also a 32x32x3 image.

The implementation was done on Google colab. Images were downloaded on to google drive and subsequently used in the notebook. 

Refer  ``` Training_code.ipynb``` for the training code .ipynb file.

Refer ```training_code.py``` for the training code .py file.

All code in this reposiroty is based on PEP-8 standards(Important for contributing to the repo).
